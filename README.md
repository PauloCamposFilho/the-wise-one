# Discord Bot (The Wise One)

A discord bot built using the `discord.js` library in a `node.js` environment

## Installation

`npm install`

## Dependencies

- `discord.js`
  - the discord bot library
- `mongoose`
  - the MongoDB library
- `dotenv`
  - your tried and true secrets package
- `eslint`

### How to add bot commands/replies/events

- Documentation to be done in the future.

### **Disclaimer**: This is not an open project. Changes/PR/feature requests will not be accepted at this time.

### This bot was built with the intent of only being run on a single discord server, and as such, lacks the layer to separate commands/replies (trigger commands) by different servers. This may be added in the future.

#### The sole purpose of this project is for this developer to learn how to use the `discord.js` library as well as `mongoose`.
